PROJECT UPDATE REPORT - DevEvents Website Next.js
==================================================

We built API routes: POST to create events, GET to fetch events, DELETE to remove events, a route to get events by slug, and a secure route for uploading images to Cloudinary with error handling.

We set up the database using MongoDB with Mongoose: we added connection pooling to reuse connections, caching to prevent too many connections during development, optimized settings for production, and good error handling to keep the database working reliably.

We added slug features: the system automatically creates URL-friendly slugs from event titles when saving, we added unique indexes for quick searches, we validate slugs to ensure they are correct, and we built dynamic pages that are good for search engines.

We created data models with TypeScript: the Event model has all required fields with validation, it checks that event modes are valid options, it validates arrays for agenda and tags, it automatically formats dates and times correctly, and the Booking model checks that events exist before creating bookings.

We set up Cloudinary for image handling: we configured it using environment variables with API keys, images are automatically uploaded with size and quality adjustments, we built a secure endpoint for client-side uploads, and we added proper error handling for when uploads fail.
